This directory includes enough sample data to serve a real flask site ( just about ).
Edits to the python will be live loaded.
The site will be served on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

caveats:
Only use this setup for development: I've included a sample "real" apache wsgi config as a template for a live site.
I'm not responsible for anything that happens after reading this.
I'm not responsible for anything that happened before reading *this*.

good luck.
